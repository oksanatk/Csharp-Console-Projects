<h1>C# Practice by Building Console Apps</h1>
This repo is meant to document different apps built by me. 

Sometimes the apps follow a tutorial, sometimes they are made from scratch by me to meet the criteria of a challenge. Links to tutorials below for easy reference.

### TSCA-CoffeeShop-SpeechRecognition
Using Azure's Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech

- Microsoft's [quickstart docs guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-servhttps://youtu.be/XMJS-eQ4Y48ice/get-started-speech-to-text?tabs=windows%2Cterminal&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- The C# Academy's Speech-to-Text tutorial from Youtube found [here](https://youtu.be/XMJS-eQ4Y48)

### RussianBakery-SpeechRecognition
Highly similar to the above coffee shop. Extra practice with Azure's Speech Recognizer, this time modifying the language and culture settings of Console inputs and outputs.

### ContosoPetClinic_applet

Based on a challenge project in Microsoft's Foundational C# course Challenge Project [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-develop-conditional-branching-looping/2-prepare)

Note: I modified the challenge to meet all functional criteria, but using an Animal `Class` instead of the suggested 2-D `string[]`
